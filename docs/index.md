**DoctorBase is a desktop application designed for doctors to manage patient records and appointments efficiently.**  
It combines a responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI) with powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) commands, allowing users who prefer keyboard-based workflows to work quickly and precisely.

DoctorBase is ideal for medical practitioners or clinic staff who want a lightweight, easy-to-use, and offline tool to organize patient information, track medical history, and schedule upcoming appointments, all in one place.
